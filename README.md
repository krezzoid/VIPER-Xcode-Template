## VIPER vs RxVIPER

This repository contains two templates `VIPER` and `RxVIPER`.

*VIPER* - based on classical understanding of VIPER architecture and you are free to use without an additional knowledge from your side.

*RxVIPER* - this template assume that you familiar with [Reactive Programming](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) and would like to use adopt usage of VIPER to your project with RxSwift. This template don't contains Wireframe and ViewInterface, as well as any delegates interfaces. Instead of it interfaces of Presenter, Interactor and DataManager should provide Rx events to callers.
